<h2> site:</h2>
Name , Organization name plus site
Simranjit Singh site: LinkedIn

<h2> Double Quotes " "</h2>
We can only specify quotes which means in this order only
"PU cybersecurity course id" site: reddit

<h2> Wildcard / Operaters aka or/and</h2>

<h2> Searching Passwords</h2>
Say we want to search for password for Tesla 
(i.e. somebody was searching for credentials on google)

```
site:tesla.com password 
```

Maybe we are not gonna write password like a regular search but can add some creativity like passwd or pass etc.....
```
site:tesla.com password filetype:pdf
```
![[Pasted image 20230911142311.png]]

site:tesla.com  filetype:pdf pass
site:tesla.com  filetype:xlsx pass
"tesla.com"  filetype:xlsx passwd
"tesla.com"  filetype:xlsx pass


>[!important] U don't need to find the Passwords
>Instead you could find sensitives file out there
