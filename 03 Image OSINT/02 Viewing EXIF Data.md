**Viewing EXIF (exchangeable image file) Data:**
- It is important cuz sometimes that data is being tied to person's location as well as what type of phone they were using even when was the photo taken.
- It is rock solid evidence to have in an investigation.
- If you have a photo of ur subject that you are investigating always look at the EXIF data.

I have checked my phone and 
location tag was off as well as the watermark and phone name tag is also off.

So the only data that image is containing is 
- Mobile Model 
- Camera Model

So i advise to send the SS of the image or mask the data before sending a photo cuz it could link back to you easily.
