It seems nothing works at this point of time lets hope new tools are built or we have to stick with manual testing till any new tools are out............................


Things really change with time and only 3 websites are operational at this time.

Even twitonomy didn't worked as expected or as shown in the video cuz most of the data now is forbidden.
