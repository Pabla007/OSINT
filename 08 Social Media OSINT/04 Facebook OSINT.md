Track down as much info as you could.................................
Facebooks searching is difficult to keep up with as there are a lot of graphical searching that just does not exist anymore.

If we do something like Tracelabs or Find Missing Person:
Will check there Facebook if the user had a salfie that selfie could reflect behind them the

What phone they were having ?_?
What is the last know location ?_?

What you can determine from the picture ?_?
Who knows who and how did they know them.
