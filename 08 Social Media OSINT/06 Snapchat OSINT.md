Snapchat doesn't have a ton of OSINT according to Mentor's opinion.

As we have already seen how to enumerate for a username and might get the actual username
But there is one more feature of snapchat that will see:

It's always dangerous to click on this as you have no idea what we might seeeeeeeee
Let's see we want to try to look into airport or something along these lines

We might get personal information like sometimes people use to share there snap-code
It's good to see what the area looks like if we don't get latest images anywhere else

I must the feature is more of video stuff but might get handy when nothing goes on our side.
