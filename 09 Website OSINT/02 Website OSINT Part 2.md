At hacker's point of view we have to find websites that are owned by the Organization and we are trying to find the subdomains out there that aren't supposed to be available to the public.

Sometimes we are not able to hunt the domains via Google so here are some ways to hunt down the sub-domains and kind of look through them.

SO it's not easy to narrow this down 

Subdomains Websites are not the goto tools that the mentor recommends but one of the fav site is cert.sh
as we can search for wildcard aka %.organization name

We got 100 hundreds of sub-domains that to of different levels
