Twint is a tool that allows us to scrape twitter wtihout going to twitter but still the best way is to go to Twitter and use advance search as it provides graphical view.

```
pip3 install --upgrade -e git+https://github.com/twintproject/twint.git@origin/master#egg=twint pip3 install --upgrade aiohttp_socks
```

Rabbit HOLE

Look at these things before installing any toold blindly.......from github
how many stars they have 
When was it last updated

This is the tool that the mentor has been using

But i will install a different tool but with the same approach
https://github.com/Datalux/Osintgram.git

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py --username USERNAME
```
It's not working i don't know let's go back to mentor's got repo
even the mentor's tool is not working and giving user not found error again and again.

Will stick to manual OSINT for this sites for now........
