Propaganda is a tricky beast. It can be a mix of straight-up lies (disinformation), innocent mistakes (misinformation), or even using real info in harmful ways (malinformation). The main goal? To sway people, often by hitting them in the feels more than the facts. In my opinion, I would say that it's possible to incorporate all.

Â One of the things I like with Firefly and Mid Journey is you can make multiple pictures with the image so you can have a variety to upload.
